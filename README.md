# AngularJS SharedData service

Simplify communication between your AngularJS components by subscribing to controlled, namespaced 'shared data' objects. Treat them as regular JavaScript objects: updating a value will immediately propagate to all other subscribers. Assign them to a scope, hook up an ng-model and watch Angular's 2-way binding break out of its controller confines.

## Usage

Open up index.html in `showcase` for several usecases that contain working examples.

## TODOS

Test coverage and documentation underway.
